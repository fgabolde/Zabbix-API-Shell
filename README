zapishell - Interactive CLI to manipulate Zabbix data, based on Zabbix::API

This distribution contains an interactive command line tool based on
Zabbix::API and Term::Shell, allowing users to interact with a Zabbix
server in a not-too-clicky way.

  $ fetch Host 10045
  $ examine Host 10045

Since it makes use of Term::Shell, there are such interesting
features as tabbed completion (in some, but not all places), and
history support, depending on your Term::ReadLine implementation.
It's been tested with Term::ReadLine::Gnu, anyway.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

    perldoc Zabbix::API::Shell

Keep in mind that this distribution is ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE, which
mostly means I have decided that it's not CPAN-worthy yet, and so it
hasn't been properly packaged yet.  Also there are no tests, which is
a problem.
